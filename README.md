# emoji game - react-redux-materialUI

npm install npm start, enjoy.
at some point perhaps I'll think of some more heiroglyphs to add.
but first I'm going to make a version of this for phones using Twilio!
and another one in react native for my RN students.
will post the links here when they're ready, should be soon.

and, for students -- notice how all the necessary logic is in the game reducer!
the components are just for view.
this sets me up really nicely to port it to other environments or frameworks,
or a completely different look, if I want to, and it keeps the logic nice and
easy to reason about.
